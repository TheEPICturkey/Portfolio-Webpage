  <div class="AboutMe">
    <h3> About <em><strong>ME</strong></em> </h3>
    <p>I was born in Washington state. Growing up, my uncle Randy Lewis (famous for his "This or That" brand) taught himself coding, and editing. His work was always amazing to me and I wanted to learn how to do what he did. After branching out and meeting with may coders and software developers, i set my mind on coming to Epicodus to make the best life for myself. In this list are a few of my favorite things.</p>  
      <ul>
      <li>Cheese</li> 
      <li>Gaming</li> 
      <li> Hiking</li>
      </ul>
