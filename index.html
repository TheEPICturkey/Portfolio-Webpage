    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <img src="img/Brandon.jpg" alt="A picture of Brandon Spear.">

    <p><span class="Fancy Letters"></span>I am a young learning Developer, born in Washington. I strive to learn as much as i can to give back to the community thats helped me to get this far.</p>
    <p><span class="Fancy Letters"></span>When I was younger, I had an uncle (www.randylewiscreative.com) who was really into computers. He is self taught and does a wide variety of operations. He taught me many things growing up, and frankly, i wanted to follow his career path as his day to day always seemed amazing to me. Once i had the money, and after doing hours of research, I found that Epicodus stood out, and that most coporate level workers i knew recommended this program. I am excited to grow my future so that one day i can help others just like my uncle helped me.</p>
    <p><span class="Fancy Letters"></span></p>In my free time, I love to play video games, go on hikes, and read books.
